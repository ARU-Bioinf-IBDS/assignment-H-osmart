Subject: You need to support accented characters.

Hi Guys,

Love your product but we got a big problem. We accept
accented characters:

é à è ù

in passwords and need the count_vowels function to count
these letters as vowels.

We need this change to be made ASAP otherwise we will switch suppliers!

Salut!
