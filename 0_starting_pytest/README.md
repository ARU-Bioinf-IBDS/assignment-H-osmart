# Using pytest to unit test code

This is a follow me exercise to introduce `pytest` unit tests.

* First print out (or view) a reference card on pytest:
  *  [pytest_basic_usage_reference_card.pdf](pytest_basic_usage_reference_card.pdf) 
     (PDF for printing)
  *  [pytest_basic_usage_reference_card.md](pytest_basic_usage_reference_card.md) 
     (markdown for viewing)
* Then view the video:
  * *"Introducing pytest to unit testing"*
    
   **TODO: record osmart Dec 2018

  * [My notes for making the video](video_notes.md)
