# Instructions for Assignment H: Unit tests and File IO

## Learning objectives
*


## Assignment task.

* This week's assignment is to tackle the [Rosalind Problem:
  Computing GC Content](http://rosalind.info/problems/gc/)
  where you are given a number of DNA sequences in a FASTA file format
  and we need to find the sequence with the highest %GC content.
  So firt read through the problem,
  including the section *Identifying Unknown DNA Quickly* (that you must
  click to expand).
* But do not start coding yet! We are going to see how to tackle the problem
  in a systematic approach using software testing. To do this work through
  the instructions below.

## Software Testing
In this practical you are going to start using 'Unit tests'
for functions. The 'unit' in this call we an individual
function and the tests are a set of function input parameters
and expected return values.

Unit tests forms an important part of modern software development,
