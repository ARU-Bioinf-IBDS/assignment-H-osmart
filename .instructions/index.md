# Instructions for Assignment H: Unit tests and File IO

## Practical Learning Outcomes
By the end of this practical you will be able to:
* Understand how unit tests can be used in the software development process.
* Use `pytest` to run existing Python unit tests.
* Write Python code to read and write to files.   


## Assignment task.

* This week's assignment is to tackle the [Rosalind Problem:
  Computing GC Content](http://rosalind.info/problems/gc/)
  where you are given a number of DNA sequences in a FASTA file format
  and we need to find the sequence with the highest %GC content.
  So firt read through the problem,
  including the section *Identifying Unknown DNA Quickly* (that you must
  click to expand).
* But do not start coding yet! We are going to see how to tackle the problem
  in a systematic approach using software testing. To do this work through
  the instructions below.

## Software Testing
In this practical we are going to see how testing can be used to
aid software development. First watch this video:

## Unit tests
In this practical you are going to start using 'Unit tests'
where individual 'units' of code are tested.
At this stage we will be testing individual functions
and the tests are a set of function input parameters
and expected return values.

Unit testing forms an important part of modern software development,

The Python standard library has a reasonable unit testing module called `unittest`

Although Python has a reasonable
