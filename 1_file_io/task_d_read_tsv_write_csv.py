# instructions: write Python to read in the data from tsv file 
# 'lmb_nobel_prizes.tsv' then
# (a) in the Nobel Prize Winners items, replace the '&' characters with 'and'
# (b) print out each row 
# (c) save just the dates and names in a CSV file 'lmb_out.csv'
#
# Question: in 2002 there are 3 prize winners and so there is a comma in the 
# names field how is this handled in the output CSV file?
