# Reading and writing files in Python

* First print out (or view) reference card:
  *  [fileio_in_python.pdf](
     ../.instructions/1_file_io/fileio_in_python.pdf)
     (PDF for printing)
  *  [fileio_in_python.md](
     ../.instructions/1_file_io/fileio_in_python.md)
     (markdown for viewing)

* Then work through the mini-exercises below to introduce Python fileIO.
* All of the starting Python files can be found in the `1_file_io/` subdirectory
  of the assignment repo. So open a terminal cd into the assignment repo and then
  ```
  cd 1_file_io
  ```
* For each mini-exercise it is best to try the exercise yourself, 
  then watch the run-through video and compare
  approach to your solution. If get stuck use the video as a follow me exercise
  doing exactly what is shown. After each video you can find GitHub links to
  the commits made that give full details as to the code changes.

#### Mini-exercise 1a. Read a text file and print out its contents.
